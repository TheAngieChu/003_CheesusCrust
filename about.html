        <p>Joey Cheesus loves baking. He loves pizza. And he loves Jesus. With that combination of loves and his surname being what it is,
            he chose to run a pizza business out of his dorm room starting in 2008.
            </p>
        <p>His dormmates loved his pizzas, and Joey funneled the money
            into purchasing textbooks and paying lab fees. As word of his endeavours spread, Joey realized he had a winning plan.
            </p>
        <p>He graduated in 2012 with a Business degree. He immediately put his degree to work and spread the news of his business throughout
            town via flyers and this very website. He chose to call it "Cheesus Crust", and by 2014, he'd earned enough for his very own
            storefront.
